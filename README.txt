This is a short program I've written to answer some basic probability questions about Pokemon moves
that I did not know how to do the math for by hand.

all functions and moves (with accuracies) are listed in dictionaries at the top of the program before
being fed into the functions so all the data is modular and can be expanded without having to rewrite
any functions 

List of Functions:

Use Until Miss / Hit:
runs a simulation for the selected move and tallies each time the move succeeds / fails an accuracy 
check before it misses / hits

Average Hits / Misses
uses the previous functions in "data only mode" to find the average outputs over 100,000 trials

Safety Calculator
outputs the average percentage of "safety checks" that the selected move will pass
for this function I defined "safe" as a condition of a move to pass an accuracy check 10 times
in succession
